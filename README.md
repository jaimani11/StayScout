# StayScout AI

> AI-native travel orchestration. Describe your trip in a sentence; specialized agents handle the rest.

## Status

**Slice A — Cinematic Foundation: complete.** Type a sentence, see a typed JSONL stream of agent steps, watch a Trip Board materialize. Pin to compare. Refine in plain English. Mood snapshots, memory hints, detail view, marketing scroll — all in.

**Slice B1 — Persistence + Auth: complete (mock-safe).** Saved trips persist via a `SessionStore` interface with two implementations: an in-memory store (default) and a Postgres-backed Prisma store (active when `DATABASE_URL` is set). Anonymous sessions own trips by sessionId; signing in (Clerk, when configured) migrates them to the user's id idempotently.

**Slice B2 — Orchestrator → LangGraph: complete (opt-in).** The hand-rolled orchestrator now has a LangGraph-driven peer behind `STAYSCOUT_ORCHESTRATOR=langgraph`. Same `run()` contract, same event stream — verified by a parity test that deep-equals event sequences from both engines. Mock-safe: `MemorySaver` checkpoint default, `PostgresSaver` when `DATABASE_URL` is set.

**Slice B3 — Saved trip resurfacing + share links: complete.** Saved trips become first-class — clicking one resurfaces the proposal on the canvas; sharing produces an unguessable `/t/[slug]` URL with a "Save to my StayScout" CTA so recipients can fork into their own bucket. Slug is lazy-minted on first share (~95 bits of entropy). The public read sanitizes owner-identifying fields and the original raw prompt at the SessionStore boundary, not the route handler.

## Quick start

Requires Node 22+, pnpm 9+ (use `corepack enable` to install). **No API keys needed for local dev.**

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # → http://localhost:3000
```

Without env vars, the app runs in mock mode end-to-end: deterministic provider results, in-memory session store, anonymous auth. Add keys to upgrade subsystems individually.

## Modes

Every variable is optional. The matrix shows what each one turns on:

| Subsystem | Without keys (default) | With keys |
|---|---|---|
| **Models** | Mock IntentAgent fixtures, deterministic mood snapshots | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → live Claude calls |
| **Providers** | `MockItalyProvider` (30 curated stays) + `LLMSynthesizedProvider` (mock) | (Slice B5) Booking, Expedia, Vrbo, Hotelbeds via real APIs |
| **Database** | In-memory `SessionStore` — process-local, lost on restart | `DATABASE_URL` → Postgres via Prisma. Run `pnpm db:migrate` once. |
| **Auth** | Anonymous (cookie-bound `sessionId`) — saved trips work | `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` + `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` → sign-in + auto-migration of anonymous trips |
| **Orchestrator** | Hand-rolled engine | `STAYSCOUT_ORCHESTRATOR=langgraph` → LangGraph engine (same event stream; checkpointer is `MemorySaver` unless `DATABASE_URL` is set, then `PostgresSaver`) |
| **Observability** | Console logs only | (Slice B planned) `LANGFUSE_*` → trace export |

Mixing is supported. Set just `DATABASE_URL` to persist trips without sign-in. Set just Clerk keys to enable auth without persistence (saved trips still work in-memory). Production needs all of them.

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for the full list.

## Try the wire

`/api/concierge` returns a JSONL stream of typed `OrchestratorEvent`s. Curl it directly:

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/concierge \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "anon_smoke",
    "turnId": "t_curl_1",
    "type": "compose",
    "input": { "rawInput": "Italy 7 days, family of 4, walkable, no tourist traps" },
    "clientCapabilities": {
      "supportsAdaptationDelta": true,
      "supportsMoodSnapshot": true,
      "supportsMemoryHint": true
    }
  }'
```

Expected event sequence: `session.started` → `turn.started` → `agent.step.*` (intent → search → mood) → `intent.extracted` → `provider.search.completed` → `proposal.shimmering` → `proposal.ready` → `proposal.bookmarkable` → `concierge.message` → `mood.snapshot.ready` → `turn.completed`.

## Scripts

pnpm format:check   Verify formatting (used in CI)
pnpm test           Run unit tests (skips integration)
pnpm test:live      Live-API integration tests (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY + RUN_LIVE_API_TESTS=1)
pnpm test:eval      IntentAgent golden cases against the live API (requires RUN_EVAL_TESTS=1)
pnpm db:generate    Generate the Prisma client (runs automatically post-install)
pnpm db:migrate     Apply pending migrations against DATABASE_URL (dev)
pnpm db:migrate:deploy  Apply migrations (prod-safe, no schema diff prompt)
pnpm db:studio      Open Prisma Studio against DATABASE_URL
```

## Architecture: layered folders

The `src` tree is split into layers with strict ESLint-enforced boundaries. Adding a feature should never tempt anyone to break these.

```
src/
  core/           types & contracts only — no runtime, no React, no Next imports
  agents/         IntentAgent + MoodSnapshotAgent     ← deps: core, lib
  providers/      MockItalyProvider + LLMSynthesizedProvider ← deps: core, lib
  orchestrator/   Orchestrator class + diff utilities + event stream
                                                       ← deps: core, agents, providers, lib
  lib/            ai (Anthropic client + prompts), streaming (JSONL),
                  observability (TraceLogger), session (cookie + SessionStore
                  interface, in-memory + Postgres impls), auth (AuthState +
                  AuthProvider, Clerk-aware), db (Prisma client factory),
                  env (clientFeatures + getServerFeatures runtime flags),
                  quality (taste lint), curation (moods/destinations/voice),
                  memory-hinter, theme, photos      ← deps: core
  features/       UI features (workspace, marketing, landing, shared)
                                                       ← deps: anything except app
  app/            Next.js routes — thin glue       ← deps: anything
  styles/         design tokens, globals.css
```

Allowed import direction: `app → features → orchestrator → agents/providers → lib → core`.
The reverse fails CI (verified via `boundaries/dependencies` rule).

## Conventions

- TDD where it makes sense (logic, parsers, agents, providers). Visual components get manual verification + the existing pipeline gates.
- Single source of truth for UI state lives in Zustand. No component-local state for non-ephemeral data.
- The Provider interface is sacred — every real-world inventory source must fit through it.
- Optional polish (mood snapshots, memory hints) must never block the critical path.
- Editorial voice: fragments and italics, never paragraphs and exclamations. No "discover", "unforgettable", "hidden gem", "journey". Enforced by `src/lib/quality/taste-lint.ts` in CI.
